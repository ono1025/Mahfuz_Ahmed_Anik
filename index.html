The model, run for 10 replications of 24 hours, showed that an average of 150 customers were served. The main bottleneck was identified at Sales Man 2 (Query for life style), which had the highest utilization (29.85%) and the longest average queue waiting time (1.5949 minutes). The total time required for a customer in the system averaged 11.6351 minutes.",

The analysis determined that ordering 161 cartons every 27 days is the optimal strategy, compared to the previous 50 cartons every 7-10 days. This adjustment reduced total monthly costs by 1,027 Tk and established a Reorder Point of 8 units to ensure a 95% service level against stockouts.",

Through a systematic product design process including concept screening and 3D modeling, the team fabricated a physical prototype with a calculated mass-production cost of 75 BDT per unit. Despite limitations such as the lack of food-grade coating, the project demonstrated the product's potential as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for the local market.",

                        I am <strong>Mahfuz Ahmed Anik</strong>, a recent graduate of Industrial and Production Engineering at 
                        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-800"> Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)</span> with a CGPA of 3.80/4.00 (3rd position in Class). 
                        I have a strong foundation in operation Research, supply chain management, data science, and AI/ML, 
                        which shaped my research journey. My research is dedicated to developing human-centric, safe, and reliable models for healthcare, transportation,
                        clinical applications, and process optimization. My research interests lie at the intersection of 
                        Artificial Intelligence, Data-Driven learning under uncertainty and Optimization, focusing in healthcare, 
                        additive manufacturing, supply chain optimization and transportation. I am also curious about Graph Machine Learning (GNNs) 
                        and Agentic AI frameworks.

                        My research has been published in workshop venues associated with <strong>ICLR, ACL, NAACL, and CSCW</strong>. Several of my 
                        journal submissions under review in peer-reviewed journal and I am engaged in multiple ongoing projects. I am a quick learner and highly adaptable, capable of working both independently and in teams. I enjoy exploring new topics, sharing knowledge, honing my skills, and pushing my limits through experimentation.
